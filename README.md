# Car-Rental-System

The system grants access based on login credentials. Customers can loop through the list of available cars, choose the number of days they want to rent the car for, and make payment. They can also cancel a car rental booking if the car hasn't been taken yet. System admins can add new cars, edit current car info, view all rental history, collect payments, add new admin accounts, generate reports, and suspend or delete customer accounts.

To Run this system:
- Fork and Clone repository
- Install NetBeans
- Run the Login form file
- Get the credentials from "Admin.txt" or "Customer.txt" files 
- Enter credentials and proceed to use the system
